Building EC2 AMIs for docker-worker
===================================

First of all, you need proper taskcluster credentials. You can use the
[taskcluster-shell](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/clients/client-shell)
tool to get it:
```sh
# eval $(taskcluster signin)
```
You also need the
[Taskcluster team passwordstore repo](https://github.com/taskcluster/passwordstore-garbage)
proper configured. Talk to :dustin to know how to get access to it.
The deploy scripts require node version >= 12.11.0.
With all these done, type:
```sh
# ./deploy.sh <docker-worker source code path> <build target>
```
To build docker-worker AMIs. The build target is either `app` or `base`. The base image
is used to accelarate the process the more common app image. You can also tag a github
release with:

```sh
# ./release.sh
```

To be able to do a Github release, you need a proper key stored in the environment
variable `DOCKER_WORKER_GITHUB_TOKEN`.

The generate AMI IDs must be update in the
[ci-configuration](https://hg.mozilla.org/ci/ci-configuration/)
and [community-tc-config](https://github.com/mozilla/community-tc-config) repositories.


Building under Vagrant
======================

Install vagrant on your system, and a virtualisation backend, such as Virtual Box.

For example, on macOS:

```
$ brew cask install vagrant
$ brew cask install virtualbox
```

Install a vagrant provider plugin to match the backend you chose, and install the `vagrant-reload` plugin:

```
$ vagrant plugin install virtualbox
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload
```

Install VirtualBox Guest Additions:

```
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
$ vagrant vbguest
$ vagrant reload default
```

Clone `docker-worker` and `docker-worker-deploy` as _sibling_ directories on your system, e.g.

```
$ mkdir -p ~/git
$ cd ~/git
$ git clone git@github.com:taskcluster/docker-worker.git
$ git clone git@github.com:taskcluster/docker-worker-deploy.git
```

Bring up the vagrant machine:

```
$ cd ~/git/docker-worker
$ vagrant up
```

SSH into the machine, initialise `/worker` directory, and build the docker images locally:

```
$ vagrant ssh
$ cd /worker
$ ./build.sh
$ curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
$ exit
$ vagrant ssh
$ yarn install
```

Export credentials for running integration tests:

```
$ export TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID='......'
$ export TASKCLUSTER_ACCESS_TOKEN='......'
$ export TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL='......'
```

Run tests:

```
$ ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha
```
